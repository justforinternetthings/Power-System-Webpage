    <h1>Hard Power Systems</h1>
    <p>AI Overview
Hard power systems in anime are
characterized by well-defined rules, clear limitations, and logical applications, often focusing on how characters strategically use their abilities rather than just having high power levels. 
Here are top examples of anime with hard power systems based on search results:
Top Recommendations

    Hunter x Hunter (Nen): Widely considered the gold standard for hard power systems. Nen is complex, well-structured, and emphasizes limitations (Vows and Restrictions) to increase power, making battles deeply tactical.
    Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (Alchemy): Operates on the strict, ironclad rule of "Equivalent Exchange"—to obtain something, something of equal value must be given.
    World Trigger (Trion System): Features a highly technical, tactical system where characters use limited, specific weapons (Triggers) and work in squads, focusing heavily on strategy and limitations.
    JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (Stands): While it sometimes breaks its own rules, Stands represent a highly rigid system where each user has a unique, consistent ability with defined constraints.
    A Certain Scientific Railgun/Index (Esper Powers): Powers are explicitly physics-based with clear, unchanging limits. 

Other Notable Hard Systems

    Dorohedoro (Magic/Smoke): Sorcerers produce unique smoke with specific effects, and their strength is determined by the purity, density, and quantity of their smoke.
    The Law of Ueki (Talents): Competitors are given specific, often eccentric abilities (e.g., turning trash into trees) and are restricted by strict rules that, if broken, cause them to lose their powers.
    Darker Than Black (Contractor Abilities): Characters possess specific, powerful abilities but must pay a "price" (a specific, often inconvenient action) every time they use them.
    Bungou Stray Dogs (Ability Users): Characters have unique, consistent, and usually singular abilities.
    Saga of Tanya the Evil (Magic/Computing Jewels): Uses a technology-based magic system with strict limitations and calculations. 

Key Characteristics of Hard Systems in These Anime

    Limitations: The rules often restrict the user as much as they empower them (e.g., Nen, Alchemy, Contractor abilities).
    Strategy: Battles are often won through intelligence and exploiting the rules of the system.
    Consistency: Powers rarely change or expand in ways that feel like a "deus ex machina".</p>
