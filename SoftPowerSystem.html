    <h1>Soft Power Systems</h1>
    <p>AI Overview
In anime, a
soft power system (or soft magic system) is defined by having loose, vague, or undefined rules. Unlike "hard" systems, which focus on limitations and mechanical explanations (like Fullmetal Alchemist), soft systems emphasize thematic resonance, emotion, and "the rule of cool" to drive the narrative. 
Here are examples of soft power systems in anime based on the search results:
Top Examples of Soft Power Systems

    Devil Fruits (One Piece): Regarded as a premier "soft" system, Devil Fruits grant users nearly any power imaginable, dictated more by the needs of the story than strict limitations.
    Stands (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure): While having some rules, Stands are highly varied, with abilities often based on the user's personality or specific narrative, rather than a rigid, uniform energy system.
    Ki (Dragon Ball Z): A widely used, straightforward energy system that often acts as a vague measurement of strength.
    Demonic Powers (Chainsaw Man): Power is derived from contracts with devils, but the specific rules and limitations of these powers are often vague.
    Spiritual Energy (Yu Yu Hakusho): Power levels that focus more on energy output than detailed techniques.
    Ghibli Magic (Spirited Away, etc.): Magic in Ghibli films is highly intuitive, emotional, and rarely explained, making it a classic example of a soft system. 

Characteristics of Soft Systems

    Thematic Focus: The power aligns with the character's emotional state or personality, rather than scientific limitations.
    Unexpected Solutions: Because the rules are loose, characters can overcome obstacles in surprising, creative, or unpredictable ways.
    Narrative Convenience: Powers are often developed or revealed as needed to advance the plot, rather than being pre-defined.
    Visual Flair: Focuses on the aesthetic and "cool" factor of the ability. 

While some systems, like Cursed Energy (Jujutsu Kaisen) or Haki (One Piece), may seem complex, they are often described as having soft elements, with rules that can bend to suit the plot.</p>
