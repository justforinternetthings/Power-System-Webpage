        <!--Zeroth Section-->

        <h2>What is a power system?</h2>
        <p align="left" style="font-size: 20px;">In fiction, a
        power system is the set of rules,
        limitations, and mechanics that
        govern how characters use supernatural
        or extraordinary abilities. It is the
        "physics" of the impossible within a story's
        universe.</p>

        <p>A well-constructed power system prevents
            the plot from feeling like a series of
            convenient miracles. Instead, it creates
            tension because the audience understands
            exactly what a character can and cannot
            do.</p>

        <h2 id="section1">1. Hard vs. Soft Power Systems</h2>

        <p>The most common way to categorize these
            systems is by how clearly the rules are
            defined for the audience.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><p><b>Hard Power Systems:</b> These have strict,
            explicit rules. The reader knows the cost,
            the source, and the limits of the power.
            This allows for logical problem-solving.</p>
        </li>

            <ul>
            <li><P>Example: Fullmetal Alchemist's Alchemy.
            It follows the Law of Equivalent Exchange:
            to gain something, something of equal
            value must be lost.</P>
            </li>
            </ul>

        <li><p><b>Soft Power Systems:</b> These are mysterious and
            vague. The rules aren't fully explained, which
            preserves a sense of wonder or dread.</p>
        </li>

            <ul>
            <li><p>Example: The Lord of the Rings. We know
            Gandalf is powerful, but we don't know
            the exact "MP cost" or limit of his spells.
            </p>
            </li>
            </ul>
