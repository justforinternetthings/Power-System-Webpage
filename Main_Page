        <h2>What is a power system?</h2>
        <p align="left" style="font-size: 20px;">In fiction, a
        power system is the set of rules,
        limitations, and mechanics that
        govern how characters use supernatural
        or extraordinary abilities. It is the
        "physics" of the impossible within a story's
        universe.</p>

        <p>A well-constructed power system prevents
            the plot from feeling like a series of
            convenient miracles. Instead, it creates
            tension because the audience understands
            exactly what a character can and cannot
            do.</p>
